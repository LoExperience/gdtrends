A simple webpage ([gdtrends](https://doubledollopped.github.io/gdtrends/)) to show the adoption of GDScript on Github since 2014, when v1.0 of Godot was released. The data will be refreshed automatically every month to keep the stats up to date.

The data is collected from the github search API and only includes repos which are publicly visible.

To do / backlog:
- Count of "active" repos based on commit
- Count of repos that also uses C#
- Filters for chart
